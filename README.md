# odin-etch-a-sketch
Implementation of Etch-a-Sketch using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. This was fun to make! Stuff used in this project:
- Flex for laying out the page as well as the div grid.
- DOM manipulation. Lots of querySelectors, event listeners, setAttributes, and all that jazz.
- Taking a size input from the user to dynamically generate a grid, then modify it as the user hovers over the divs, based on the button/color chosen.
